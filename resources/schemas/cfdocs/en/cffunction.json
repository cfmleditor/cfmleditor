Any data that the server requires to identify the requested information must be in the URL or in `cfhttp type=\"URL\"` tag.\n\nPOST: Sends information to the server for processing. Requires one or more cfhttpparam tags. Often used for submitting form-like data.\n\nPUT: Requests the server to store the message body at the specified URL. Use this method to send files to the server.\n\nDELETE: Requests the server to delete the specified URL.\n\nHEAD: Identical to the GET method, but the server does not send a message body in the response. Use this method for testing hypertext links for validity and accessibility, determining the type or modification time of a document, or determining the type of server. If you have not specified HEAD, by default, GET method is called. However, message body is not sent in the response.\n\nOPTIONS: A request for information about the communication options available for the server or the specified URL. This method enables the ColdFusion application to determine the options and requirements associated with a URL, or the capabilities of a server, without requesting any additional activity by the server. If you have not specified OPTIONS, then ColdFusion sends a response.

Used to specify the MIME media type of representation a resource can produce, for example, {{produces=\"text/plain,text/html\"}}. If a resource can produce more than one MIME media type, the function chosen corresponds to the most acceptable media type as declared by the client. If no value is specified, / is taken by default, which means, all MIME types are consumed. Overrides the value that you specify at the component level.\n\n **Note**\nIf MIME type is a wildcard, the results include any value. For example, if you make a HTTP call with produces as '*/xml' and follow it up with a second HTTP call with produces as '*/json', the results in the second HTTP call might include the first call result as well.","required":false,"default":"","type":"string","values":[]},

Used to specify which MIME media types of representation a resource can accept, or consume, from the client. This attribute overrides the same attribute at the component level. If no value is specified, / is taken by default, which means, all MIME types are consumed. Adobe recommends that you avoid conflict scenarios while specifying the attributes produces and consumes. For example, avoid situations such as the following: In function 1, you specify produces as text/xml and consumes as text/ and in function 2, produces as text/ and consumes as text/xml. Here, both the functions are valid for the request with accept = text/xml and consumes as text/xml.","required":false,"default":"","type":"string","values":[]},
